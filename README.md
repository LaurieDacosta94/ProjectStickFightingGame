# Stickman Warfare Readnme

## Project Snapshot
- 2D browser-based action shooter rendered with a custom Canvas loop.
- Frontend-only architecture; no server components required.
- Build pipeline inlines assets to ship as a single self-contained HTML file.

## Current Roadmap Highlights
- Phase 6 targets universal 360-degree aiming with matching animation rigs.
- Phase 8 expands the UI stack, including in-game clickable elements and refreshed HUD flows.
- Later phases polish replayability systems, large-scale testing, and post-launch support.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Launch the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Produce the standalone build: `npm run build`

## Key Directories
- `src/` – Core gameplay logic, rendering loops, and systems.
- `styles/` – Shared styling for UI and HUD components.
- `docs/` – Design references such as the core gameplay loop documentation.
- `dist/` – Output directory for the single-file production build.

## Next Steps
- Follow the to-do list in `stickman_warfare_todo.txt` for the latest priorities.
- Keep prototype GIFs, design notes, and concept art linked through `stickman_game_presentation.md`.
