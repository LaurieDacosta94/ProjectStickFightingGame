# Stickman Warfare: The Ultimate Sandbox Combat

## 🎮 Core Concept  
Players control a customizable stick figure in a **2D environment**, built entirely in **JavaScript** and playable directly in the **browser**.  
The game is a **frontend-only project with no backend**, ensuring fast, client-side execution.  
For distribution, the game will be compacted into a **single self-contained HTML file** using build tools, so it can be shared and played easily.  
Gameplay is fast-paced and physics-driven, blending **melee martial arts, modern weaponry, explosives, vehicles, and squad tactics** into a chaotic yet tactical sandbox. Every environment is reactive, ensuring each battle feels dynamic and unpredictable.
